## üìñ Usage Guide

### Starting the Application
Launch the POS system by running `main.py`. The main interface will display:
- **Left Panel**: Available products in a grid layout
- **Right Panel**: Current order cart and checkout options

### Managing Products
1. Click **"Manage Products"** in the top-right of the products area
2. Use the product manager to:
   - Add new products with ID, name, price, and stock quantity
   - Edit existing product details
   - Delete products from inventory
   - Save changes to update the main display

### Processing Sales

4. **Checkout**: Click "Proceed to Checkout" when ready
5. **Payment**: Enter cash amount tendered to calculate change
6. **Complete Sale**: Review receipt and finalize the transaction

### File Management
- **Products File**: `products.txt` stores all product information
- **Sales File**: `sales.txt` records all completed transactions
- **Import/Export**: Use the product manager to load/save different product files

## üìÅ File Structure

```
PointOfSales/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ products.txt         # Product database (pipe-delimited)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sales.txt           # Sales transaction history
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .venv/              # Virtual environment (created during setup)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/               # Git repository files
```

## üìä Data Format

### Products File (`products.txt`)
Each line contains product information separated by pipes:
```
product_id|product_name|price|stock_quantity
```

Example:
```
prod_1001|Cafe Latte|4.5|100
prod_1002|Cappuccino|4.75|100
```

### Sales File (`sales.txt`)
Stores completed transactions in JSON format with:
- Transaction ID
- Timestamp
- Items sold
- Payment details
- Total amount

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application uses a centralized configuration system in `main.py`:

```python
CONFIG = {
    "tax_rate": 0.08,           # 8% sales tax
    "currency_symbol": "$",     # Currency display
    "products_file": "products.txt",
    "sales_file": "sales.txt",
}
```

## üé® Customization

### Color Scheme
Modify the `COLORS` dictionary in `main.py` to change the application's appearance:

```python
COLORS = {
    'primary': '#4f46e5',       # Main brand color
    'secondary': '#64748b',     # Secondary elements
    'success': '#10b981',       # Success/checkout buttons
    'danger': '#ef4444',        # Remove/delete buttons
    # ... more color definitions
}
```

### Tax Rate
Update the tax rate in the `CONFIG` dictionary to match your local requirements.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tkinter Not Found**
   - Ensure Python is properly installed with Tkinter
   - On Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

2. **File Permission Errors**
   - Ensure the application has write permissions in the project directory
   - Check that `products.txt` and `sales.txt` are not read-only

3. **Data Loading Errors**
   - Verify `products.txt` follows the correct format
   - Check for malformed lines or invalid data types

4. **Display Issues**
   - Try adjusting your screen resolution
   - The application is designed for 1200x750 minimum resolution
